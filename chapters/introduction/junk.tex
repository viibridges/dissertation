Hold-Geoffroy \etal~\cite{hold2017perceptual}
improve~\cite{workman2016horizon}'s results by using deeper networks,
and introduce a new perceptual measure for horizon line detection.
Unlike the previous work that mainly focus on horizon line detection,
Zhang \etal~\cite{zhang2018dominant} propose to detect the dominant
vanishing point using deep neural networks.
